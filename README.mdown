# Install

There is heavy use of submodules so I would recommend that you grab this with:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/rabidpraxis/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    rake install

## ZSH setting

I would recommend using ZSH. It has many great features that I will not go into right here. If you want to change your shell default then you can use this command:

    chsh -s /bin/zsh
